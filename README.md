# csvchirp

This project has both a python and a golang program.

The input to either of the programs is an RT Systems csv export file.  As of this time, the RT Systems csv file does not escape commas properly, normally in the comments.

The ouput of these programs is a csv file that can be used as an import file to CHIRP.  I have attempted to create the same download file as the one available from repeaterbook, within the limits os the input data.
